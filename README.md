# UnityGBHorror
 This is my first study Unity project and it was supposed to be just cubes and plains. But it turned out that it's not so easy not to make a game) So I was doomed to make it to a playable little survival shooter. And I had so much fun making it.
 
 This project is completed. You can find some gameplay video or download a build on https://muninyar.itch.io/dim
